# AsyncWeb

Mod that makes web requests asynchronous.

Allows you to do stuff like view comments while downloading a song.

<cr>Too many web requests can and WILL get you rate limited, do not abuse by spamming as many things as you can. I am not responsible for your own actions, here be dragons.</c>

Currently this mod does not change functionality such as queued song/sfx downloads, though that is a potential point of interest for changing in the future.

## Known Issues

Progress bars for song downloads do not work, don't fret as it is still downloading.
